Tips and Tricks
- Run bearing and range node with different prefix
- Todo: Add NodeHandle with a prefix to both bearing and range node so that it works on different
    namespace when you run on different rovers
- Validate the assumption that odometry node publishes absolute pose
  - Done
- Add Odometry node when adding range and bearing data
  - Done
- Publish updated path data as well.
  - Done
- Odometry is dx, dy, dtheta
  - Done
